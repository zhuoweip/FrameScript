Welcome to Scene Manager!
=============================

Thank you for buying Scene Manager. You can find the quick start tutorial and latest documentation
of Scene Manager on our website http://www.ancientlightstudios.com/scenemanager. 

You can find a demo project in the SceneManagerDemo folder.

If you want to use Scene Manager with playMaker(tm) there is a playMakerIntegrationPackage.unitypackage which contains
the necessary playMaker(tm) actions and a demo project. Please note: PlayMaker(tm) is not part of this package and must 
be purchased separately at the Unity asset store.

If you want to use uTomate for automating your builds there is a uTomateIntegrationPackage.unitypackage which contains
the necessary uTomate actions for automating player builds from scene configurations. Please note: uTomate is not part of
this package and must be purchased separately at the Unity asset store.
 
To add the contents of any support package to your project, simply double-click it. Unity will then show an import
dialog allowing you to import the contents.
