Scene Manager Changelog
========================= 

Version 1.4.6
................................

- New Feature: Transitions are now time scale independent by default so you can run them as well when the game is in 
  slow motion or paused. This is the new default mode for transitions. It is possible to switch the transitions
  back to time scale dependent behaviour at the transition prefabs, if required.
- New Feature: Transitions now have a new level prefetch mode which loads the level first in background and then plays the 
  transition once the level has finished loading. This feature requires Unity 4 and a Unity Pro license.
- New Feature: Mobile-friendly shaders for the Tiles, Tetris, Ninja, Newspaper and Pixelate transitions. These trade
  some visual fidelity for massively improved performance on mobile devices. You can switch the used shader at the
  transition prefabs.
- Improvement: General improvement of transition rendering speeds.  


Version 1.4.5
................................

- New Feature: Transitions now send events when changing their states. This allows for modifying transitions to 
  match your scene's contents before the actual transition starts.
- New Feature: compatible with Unity 4.3.
- Improvement: Changed the way Scene Manager loads editor resources for better performance in large projects.
- Fix: Fixed issue causing an exception when creating a scene configuration in the project's root folder in Unity 4.


Version 1.4.4
................................

- Improvement: Vastly improved Scene Manager's error messages.
- Improvement: Demo scene can now be run out of the box without having to activate a scene configuration before.
- Fix: Fixed incompatibility with uTomate 1.2.0.


Version 1.4.3
................................

- Improvement: SceneManager can now be placed in a subfolder without breaking the inspector GUI.
- Fix: Marker textures for Levels and Screens should not pollute projects anymore.


Version 1.4.2
................................

- Fix: Changed packaging of Chili4U library back to sources as the DLL packaging introduced a lot of issues.


Version 1.4.1
................................

- Added compatibility fix to make the PRO transitions work better with deferred rendering mode.

Version 1.4.0
................................

- Added support for grouping levels
- New demo project showing grouped levels
- Inspector lists can now be resized which aids in handling larger amounts of levels.
- Inspector now supports Drag & Drop, which makes it a lot easier to change the order of levels.
- Backwards-incompatible API changes:
 
  * SMSceneManager.LoadLastPlayedLevel is now deprecated. Use LoadNextLevel instead.
  * SMILevelProgress has been extended to support group progress. If you made an own implementation of SMILevelProgress
    you need to add the new methods.
